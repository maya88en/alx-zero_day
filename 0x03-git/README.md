My first readme
Task 4: Collaboration: be up to date
Only for this task â€“ I should update my file README.md in the main branch from GitHub.com
I have created a branch with three directories while in the master I modified the alx and deleted the js, so there is a conflict I should solve in the advanced level by merge.
